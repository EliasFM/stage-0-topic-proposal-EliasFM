                <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The epidemic of drug abuse has come into the national spotlight
                    as more and more people are dying from opioid overdoses. The numbers 
                    involved are staggering, and as american's perspective on drugs shifts,
                    so is the shift in what the issue is about drugs. For a long time drug use
                    has been considered to be a personal issue, but as the opioid deaths continue
                    to rise, theres began a realization that this is a social issue. That this 
                    stems from a problem in our society is reflected in how different areas are 
                    affected by this issue.

                <h2>
                    The Goal
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Hopefully these visualizations and analysis will enable both voters to 
                    understand the depth and scope of this issue, and policy makers to see
                    how much this affects them. If successful this could nudge people to doing
                    right by the people suffering from an epidemic of painkiller overprescription.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another reason this has become so much more important, is that during the 
                    presidential elections the overdose epidemic was constantly talked about
                    and now it feels like its being glossed over. Maybe because it's an 
                    uncomfortable topic. It also could be that there's a lot of lobbying
                    money pouring in from the drug companies which supply painkillers,
                    a side effect of how long they've achieved a dominance over US health
                    care systems, based off of lies like opioids are non addictive. (an actual
                    claim by oxycotin used in their advertising)
