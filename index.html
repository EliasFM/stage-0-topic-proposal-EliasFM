    <h1>Proposal for a Drug Abuse Web Application</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The area I want to explore with this project is drug abuse and overdoses. The issues surrounding drug abuse
            have become mainstream with the opioid epidemic, and the realization that rather than this being a moral 
            issue it's a social issue.  
            </p><p>
            This shift in mindset is fascinating and I think it'd be interesting to do 
            an independent survey of the field of drug use, abuse, and overdosage in the midst of a changing regulation
            landscape. The current information in the field is still fresh, and while opioids dominate headlines,
            there are many drugs that have been overlooked. In addition the legalization of marijuana has become
            common across North America.
        </p><p>
            The importance of the data being fresh is two fold, one there isn't a lot of reliable studies of the data,
            and second the studies and visualizations are in no way guaranteed to be presenting fully valid findings. 
            This data with new regulations is far too new to see broad impacts, however setting up the infrastructure
            to track and see the changes would be interesting if possible.

            Possible Applications
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A possible idea is to see if in states/cities where drug regulations have changed, if 
                the health statistics from those locales have shifted in response. The value of this is 
                in future policy, if this shows that loosening or tightening regulation reduces abuse and 
                overdoses, then it's possible to help more people. Policy makers could look at this and 
                see what approaches are most useful and how long approaches take before results start being
                seen.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another possible idea is to create an app that shows the change in opioids sold in states
                with legal marijuana. This sidesteps the issue of lag time for regulation, and instead 
                examines one of the sources of the opioid epidemic, a population which has been prescribed 
                addictive painkillers as the first step rather than as an extreme step in healthcare. 
                This would be helpful in seeing how much legalization of marijuana can help combat
                the opioid epidemic.
