# Course Project

This site contains a movie browing app, that can search as well as filter results.

The parts we took from our projects:
We used both of our api's, Anushka's for searching and filtering, and Elias's for the detailed card view.
We used parts of both of our card and css implementations.
We used both our ideas of a search and added a filter set of interactions.
We added a new interaction to the cards to have them change on click of the card to the more detailed view and vice versa. This allows for more fluidity of use and a better mobile experience.

The site can be viewed at <https://info340c-au18.github.io/stage-0-topic-proposal-EliasFM/>

This site was bootstrapped with Create React App
