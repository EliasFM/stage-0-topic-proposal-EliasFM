        <h2>Why are we doing this</h2>
        <p>
            The area I want to explore with this project is drug abuse and overdoses. The issues surrounding drug abuse
            have become mainstream with the opioid epidemic, and the realization that rather than this being a moral 
            issue it's a social issue.  
            </p>
        <p>
            This shift in mindset is fascinating and I think it'd be interesting to do 
            an independent survey of the field of drug use, abuse, and overdosage in the midst of a changing regulation
            landscape. The current information in the field is still fresh, and while opioids dominate headlines,
            there are many drugs that have been overlooked. In addition the legalization of marijuana has become
            common across North America.
        </p><p>
            The importance of the data being fresh is two fold, one there isn't a lot of reliable studies of the data,
            and second the studies and visualizations are in no way guaranteed to be presenting fully valid findings. 
            This data with new regulations is far too new to see broad impacts, however setting up the infrastructure
            to track and see the changes would be interesting if possible.

                                    <p class="card-text">Hi! I'm an informatics students with an interest in public health, mapping, and data.
                                        I did a data science internship over the summer where we explored the relationship between 
                                        demographics and social issues. One of the things we explored but didn't pursue was
                                        the relationship between demographics and opioid abuse. It's become a sensationalized topic
                                        but political willpower feels weak with the amount of lobbying money being thrown around. So 
                                        I hope that this will add clarity to the situation and perhaps provide some guidance to public policy.

                                        It hasn't faced the issue of opioid overdoses that pervade america. Now it might be better policy,
                                        better healthcare, or a difference in view of what the issue is. Rather than treating opioid usage
                                        as fodder to fill private prisons, they provide safe injection sites, and attempt to rehabitalate people.
